### Hey, I'm Charlie

I am a researcher in mathematical optimization at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs)/[Zuse-Institut Berlin](https://www.zib.de/). I am interested in large-scale nonlinear optimization, reliable optimization based on interval analysis and I enjoy modern software development (mainly in C++, a bit of Julia as well). In particular, I am actively developing the [Uno solver](https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno), a modular open-source C++ library that **unifies nonlinear optimization** and offers dozens of strategy combinations. It is competitive against IPOPT and filterSQP, while being modern, lightweight and extensible. Check it out!

I got my PhD from [Université de Toulouse](https://www.univ-toulouse.fr/) (France) in January 2015. Then I was a postdoctoral researcher with [IRT Saint Exupéry](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com) (France), [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) (USA), [Fraunhofer ITWM](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/) (Germany), [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) (Germany) and [Zuse-Institut Berlin](https://www.zib.de/).

When I am not scribbling math on a black board or feverishly writing code, I enjoy playing bass with the Toto tribute band [The Cats of Oz](https://www.facebook.com/thecatsofoz), taking [landscape photos](https://www.instagram.com/charlievanaret_photo/) and doing some sort of physical activity (such as bouldering or cross-country skiing).
