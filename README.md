### Hey, I'm Charlie

I am a researcher in mathematical optimization at [Zuse-Institut Berlin](https://www.zib.de/). I am interested in developing methods for large-scale nonlinear optimization, reliable optimization methods based on interval analysis and I enjoy modern software development (mainly in C++, a bit of Julia as well). In particular, I am actively developing [Uno](https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno), an open-source C++ framework that **unifies nonlinear optimization**. Check it out!

I got my PhD from [Université de Toulouse](https://www.univ-toulouse.fr/) (France) in January 2015. Then I was a postdoctoral researcher with [IRT Saint Exupéry](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com) (France), [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) (USA), [Fraunhofer ITWM](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/) (Germany) and [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) (Germany).

When I am not scribbling math on a black board or feverishly writing code, I enjoy playing bass with the Toto tribute band [The Cats of Oz](https://www.facebook.com/thecatsofoz), taking [landscape pictures](https://www.instagram.com/charlievanaret_photo/) and doing some sort of physical activity (bouldering, cross-country skiing; at the moment, mainly digesting Christmas chocolate).
